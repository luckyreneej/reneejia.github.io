# Publications

## Academic Journey

I've been fortunate to publish some work at conferences I really admire:

- **ACL 2022**: Research on situated dialogue learning through procedural environment generation
- **AIIDE 2023**: Methods for teaching agents human-like behavior through stories

I also enjoy being part of the research community as a reviewer for conferences like ACL, EMNLP, EACL, NAACL, and CoNLL. It's a great way to stay connected with cutting-edge research!
