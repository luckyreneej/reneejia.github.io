# Tournament Poker

When I'm not working on AI research, you might find me at the poker tables! I'm a part-time tournament poker player with a passion for the strategic and mathematical aspects of the game.

## Tournament Results

I've been fortunate to achieve some notable results in various tournaments. You can view my complete tournament history and statistics at:

## Why Poker?

Poker combines several elements that I find fascinating:

- **Strategic Thinking**: Every decision requires careful analysis of probabilities and opponent behavior
- **Mathematical Modeling**: Understanding odds, pot odds, and expected value calculations
- **Psychology**: Reading opponents and managing your own emotional state
- **Risk Management**: Balancing aggression with caution in high-pressure situations

## Tournament Highlights

Some of my most memorable tournament experiences include:

- **Deep runs** in major tournament series
- **Final table appearances** in various events
- **Competing against** some of the best players in the world
- **Learning from** every session, win or lose

## Poker and AI

Interestingly, there are many parallels between poker and AI research:

- **Game Theory**: Both involve strategic decision-making under uncertainty
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying patterns in opponent behavior vs. data patterns
- **Optimization**: Finding the best strategies given available information
- **Continuous Learning**: Improving through experience and analysis
