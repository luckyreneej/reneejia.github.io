Ranking and recommendation systems power everything from **Google Search** to **Netflix suggestions**. While today's systems use **deep learning and large language models (LLMs)**, their foundations were laid decades earlier ‚Äî with ideas that are still relevant in production today.

This post curates the **classic works (1970s‚Äì2010s)** that every AI engineer working in ranking / recommendation systems should know before diving into modern architectures.

## üéØ **Key Highlights**

- **BM25 (1994)**: Still the industry standard baseline for text ranking
- **LambdaMART (2010)**: De facto standard for large-scale ranking pipelines  
- **Matrix Factorization (2009)**: Netflix Prize breakthrough that revolutionized recommendations
- **NDCG (2002)**: Gold standard metric for ranking evaluation
- **Learning to Rank**: Transition from heuristics to machine-learned ranking

## üîç 1. Ranking Foundations

### **Probabilistic Models & Lexical Retrieval**

- **[Robertson & Jones, 1976 ‚Äì The 2-Poisson Model](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/361219.361220)**  
  Early probabilistic formulation of information retrieval, paving the way for modern ranking.

- **[Okapi BM25 (Robertson & Walker, 1994)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/188490.188561)**  
  The most influential **bag-of-words ranking function** ever created. Despite neural models, BM25 is still used as a baseline in 2025.

### **Learning to Rank (LTR)**

- **[RankNet (Burges et al., 2005)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/learning-to-rank-using-gradient-descent/)**  
  First **neural approach** to ranking with a pairwise loss. Established the move from heuristics to machine-learned ranking.

- **[LambdaRank (Burges, 2006)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2006/hash/2e855f9489df1315d4423641f6c977cf-Abstract.html)**  
  Adjusted gradients to directly optimize **NDCG**, bridging the gap between ML training and ranking metrics.

- **[ListNet (Cao et al., 2007)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1273496.1273513)**  
  First **listwise approach**, training directly on permutations of ranked lists.

- **[LambdaMART (Burges, 2010)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/from-ranknet-to-lambdarank-to-lambdamart-an-overview/)**  
  Combined LambdaRank with gradient-boosted decision trees.  
  üîë **Still the de facto industry standard** for large-scale ranking pipelines.

## üë• 2. Recommendation Foundations

### **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**

- **[Breese, Heckerman & Kadie, 1998 ‚Äì Empirical Analysis of Predictive Algorithms](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220765593_Empirical_Analysis_of_Predictive_Algorithms_for_Collaborative_Filtering)**  
  Compared user-based vs. item-based collaborative filtering. A foundational evaluation.

- **[Item-based CF (Sarwar et al., 2001)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/371920.372071)**  
  First scalable CF method, widely adopted in e-commerce platforms.

### **Latent Factor Models**

- **[Matrix Factorization for Recommender Systems (Koren et al., 2009)](https://datajobs.com/data-science-repo/Recommender-Systems-[Netflix].pdf)**  
  The **Netflix Prize breakthrough**: decomposing users and items into latent vectors. Still a benchmark today.

- **[Temporal Dynamics in MF (Koren, 2009)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1557019.1557072)**  
  Extended MF with **time-sensitive embeddings**, modeling user preference shifts.

- **[Factorization Machines (Rendle, 2010)](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~b97053/paper/Rendle2010FM.pdf)**  
  Generalized MF to arbitrary sparse features, allowing second-order interactions.  
  üîë **Direct ancestor of modern feature interaction models** like DeepFM.

## üìê 3. Evaluation & Benchmarks

- **[Precision, Recall, F-measure (van Rijsbergen, 1979)](https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10686444)**  
  Core IR evaluation metrics still taught today.

- **[Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG/NDCG) ‚Äì J√§rvelin & Kek√§l√§inen, 2002](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/582415.582418)**  
  A metric designed specifically for **ranking quality**.  
  üîë Still the gold standard for search and recommendation evaluation.

- **[LETOR Benchmark (Liu et al., 2007)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/letor-learning-rank-information-retrieval/)**  
  First **public learning-to-rank dataset**, crucial for standardizing comparisons.

- **[TREC Evaluation Methodology (Voorhees & Harman, 2005)](https://trec.nist.gov/pubs/trec14/papers/overview.14.pdf)**  
  Large-scale shared evaluation tasks that shaped the culture of IR research.

## üß† Why These Papers Still Matter

1. **Conceptual clarity**: Introduced pairwise vs. listwise losses, factorization, and ranking metrics.
2. **Still in use**: BM25, LambdaMART, and Factorization Machines remain in real-world production pipelines.
3. **Building blocks**: Deep learning methods often **layer on top of these foundations** ‚Äî e.g., embeddings from MF are now learned via neural models, but the principle is the same.
