Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most exciting technology fields today. This article will provide you with a comprehensive guide to getting started with AI.

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:

- Learning
- Reasoning
- Perception
- Language understanding
- Decision making

## Main Branches of AI

### 1. Machine Learning
Machine Learning is the core of AI, enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

### 2. Deep Learning
Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to simulate how the human brain works.

### 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
NLP focuses on enabling computers to understand and generate human language.

### 4. Computer Vision
Computer Vision enables machines to "see" and understand visual information.

## Learning Path Recommendations

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Python programming
- Mathematical foundations (linear algebra, calculus, probability & statistics)
- Data structures and algorithms

### Phase 2: Machine Learning
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Reinforcement learning

### Phase 3: Deep Learning
- Neural network fundamentals
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

## Recommended Learning Resources

1. **Online Courses**
   - Coursera Machine Learning course
